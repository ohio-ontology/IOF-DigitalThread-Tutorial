## Part 1: Using Protégé
### 1.1 Introduction to Protégé
Protege is a powerful open-source ontology editor and knowledge-based framework. In this tutorial, we will walk you through the process of creating and managing ontologies using Protege.
### 1.2 Download and Install Protégé
You can download it easily from their official website (https://protege.stanford.edu/download/).
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Ensure that your computer is installed with Java because Protégé works based on Java application.

### 1.3	Launch and Setup
After you successfully installed Protégé on your device, subsequently launch the application!
- The first step is to set up an IRI (Internationalized Resource Identifier) for your ontology. In the Ontology header section, you can configure the Ontology IRI yourself. For example, you can set the Ontology IRI to http://simpom.ohio.edu/examples/f2f-2024-DigitalThread/ as shown below.
> [!NOTE]  
> In this tutorial, we will focus on simple tasks such as importing ontologies, creating classes and instances, and adding relations for this ontology only, so feel free to keep it as straightforward as possible.
